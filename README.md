# LEARNING REACT 
> Modern patterns for Developing REACT Apps



### Description 
> Start 23-09-2020

This project is my learning path to REACT. It will be done while reading the book "Learning REACT" written by Alex Banks & Eve Porcello.
My main goals are to learn more about functional programming with an obvious focus on JavaScript, learning how REACT works and create my components with the best logic/syntax I can.
